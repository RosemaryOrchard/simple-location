Adds geographic location and weather support to WordPress.

== Description == 

Supports adding geo coordinates or textual description to a post, comment, user, or attachment. Supports adding weather data to a post or to a widget. Will be supporting saving a 
location as a venue for reuse. Offers choice of map displays.

It supports retrieving location using the HTML5 geolocation API. As it stores the GeoData in a WordPress standard format, Geodata can also be added from other plugins.

Offers the opportunity to change the displayed timezone on a per-post basis for those posts from far off locations and set this based on the coordinates of the location. 
Clicking the clock icon next to the timezone will set to the browser timezone.

* If your site is set to a Manual UTC Offset as opposed to a named timezone, the timezone override feature will not work at this time

== Venues ==

Venues are locations stored as a custom taxonomy in WordPress using the Term Metadata functionality added in Version 4.4 of WordPress. Venues as taxonomies
have the advantage of supporting an archive page of all posts from that location and giving the location a permalink on your site. 

To add anything more than a basic location you will have to create a venue. This functionality is still pending.

== WordPress GeoData ==

[WordPress Geodata](http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata) is an existing standard
used to store geodata about a post, user, comment, or term.

It consists of four fields: latitude, longitude, public, and address. This matches up with the HTML5 Geolocation fields. The plugin also saves zoom which is for the purpose of map display.

== Weather ==

Weather consists of at minimum the current conditions and temperature but may include future parameters for use such as pressure, wind speed, wind direction degree, etc. A weather widget
is available that can be set to a specific location, a user, or a station ID.

Station ID is available from supported providers for weather stations, for example from a Personal Weather Station(PWS).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements to use this plugin? =

API Keys are required to use certain services.
* [Google Static Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
* [Mapbox Static Maps](https://www.mapbox.com/help/create-api-access-token/)
* [Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/)
* [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.com/api)

If not provided there will be no map displayed regardless of setting. Without a weather provider this service will not work. The appropriate API keys should be entered in Settings->Simple Location or will move to Indieweb->Location if the Indieweb plugin
if installed.

= Is this compatible with the WordPress mobile apps? =

Simple Location uses WordPress Geodata to store location, as does the WordPress app. So setting location with the app should allow it to be displayed by Simple Location.

= The Location Icon does not retrieve my location. =

Chrome Users: The button that retrieves the location using the HTML5 geolocation API will not work on Chrome if your website is not secure(https). This is a Chrome decision to ensure safe control of personal
data.

= How can I show a list of posts tagged with a location? =

You can filter any query or archive by adding `?geo={all|public|text}` to it to show only public posts with location. Adding /geo/all to the homepage or archive pages should also work

= How can I report issues or request support? =

The Development Version as well as support can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dshanske/simple-location).

== Upgrade Notice ==

Recommend backup before upgrade to Version 3.0.0 due to the start of venue support. Full location data will not be saved in the post and old posts will be converted. The display name will be saved if set, otherwise a display name will be set from the coordinates. An API key
will now be required to show maps for services that require API keys.
